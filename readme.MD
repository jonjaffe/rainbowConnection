# Rainbow Connection
### Overview

Rainbow Connection is a very sophisticated social platform in which users list their favorite color. As is customary in American culture, sharing a common favorite color is enough to make people become best friends.

### Technical overview

Rainbow Connection is a demo fullstack app built with a PHP Laravel/ MySQL backend and an Ember.js frontend. The project was created in two days with no previous experience with any of the aforementioned technologies.
